                             NEWPARK RESOURCES, INC.
              NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.      INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

        In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial position of Newpark Resources, Inc. ("Newpark" or the "Company") as of
September 30, 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999. All such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These interim financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 1999 audited financial
statements and related notes filed on Form 10-K, as amended. The results of
operations for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2000
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire
year.

        Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to
conform to the current period presentation.

B.       SALE OF SOLIDS CONTROL OPERATIONS

         In September 1999, management adopted a plan to discontinue its solids
control operations and simultaneously entered into an alliance agreement with a
division of Tuboscope, which is now providing some of these services to
Newpark's customers. The operating results for the solids control operations are
included in the results for the fluids sales and engineering segment. All solids
control contracts were completed during the second quarter of 2000. Revenues
from the solids control operations totaled $2.0 million in the third quarter of
1999. Revenues from the solids control operations totaled approximately $883,000
for the first nine months of 2000 and $5.3 million for the first nine months of
1999. These operations were at break even for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2000, and generated operating losses of approximately $2.2 million in
the third quarter of 1999 and $4.5 million for the first nine months of 1999.

         The 1999 results for the solids control operations had previously been
reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements. The previously
filed financial statements have been restated to reflect the inclusion of the
results for the solids control operations as part of continuing operations of
the fluids sales and engineering segment.

         The following table shows the previously reported and restated amounts:

C.      EARNINGS PER SHARE

        Basic net income (loss) per share was calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share for the quarter and nine months ended September 30,
2000 were calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted-average number of
dilutive stock options and warrants, which totaled 1,016,000 shares and 766,000
shares for the respective periods. Options and warrants which were considered
antidilutive because the exercise prices exceeded the average price for the
applicable period totaled approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.7 million
shares during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2000,
respectively.

        Since the Company incurred a loss per share for the quarter and nine
months ended September 30, 1999, all effects of options and warrants were
excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share for these periods.
Options and warrants excluded from the

F.      LONG-TERM DEBT

        As of September 30, 2000, the Company has outstanding $125 million of
unsecured senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") which mature on December 15,
2007. Interest on the Notes accrues at the rate of 8-5/8% per annum and is
payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15.

        As of September 30, 2000, the Company also maintained a $100.0 million
bank credit facility, including up to $20.0 million in standby letters of
credit, in the form of a revolving line of credit commitment, which expires
December 31, 2001. At September 30, 2000, $15.8 million in letters of credit
were issued and outstanding under the credit facility and $73.5 million was
outstanding under the revolving facility, leaving $10.7 million of availability
under this facility at September 30, 2000. The facility bears interest at either
a specified prime rate (9.5% at September 30, 2000) or the LIBOR rate (6.68% at
September

Company's funded debt to cash flow. The current interest rate under the credit
facility is prime plus .75% (10.25% at November 3, 2000) or LIBOR plus 3.25%
(9.85% at November 3, 2000). The Company was in compliance with all financial
covenants of the credit facility as of September 30, 2000.

H.      CHANGE IN METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR DEPRECIATION

        The Company computes the provision for depreciation on certain of its
E&P waste and NORM disposal assets and its barite grinding mills using the
unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production method of providing for
depreciation on these assets was adopted in the second quarter of 1999,
effective January 1, 1999. Prior to 1999, the Company computed the provision for
depreciation of these assets on a straight-line basis.

        The reported income for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 was
increased by $1,471,000 (related per share amounts of $.02 basic and diluted)
reflecting the cumulative effect (net of income taxes) on years prior to 1999
for the change in accounting for depreciation.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

         The following discussion of our financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our
"Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements" and "Notes to Unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements" as well as our annual report on form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 1999, as amended.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         Our operating results depend primarily on the level of oil and gas
drilling activity in the markets we serve. These levels in turn depend, to a
great extent, on oil and gas commodities pricing, inventory levels and product
demand. Key average rig count data for the last several quarters is listed in
the following table:

           The Gulf Coast market, our primary market, accounted for
approximately 75% of revenues for the first nine months of 2000 and includes:
(1) South Louisiana Land; (2) Texas Railroad Commission Districts 2 and 3; (3)
Louisiana and Texas Inland Waters; and (4) Offshore Gulf of Mexico. According to
Baker Hughes Incorporated, as of the week ended November 3, 2000, the U.S. rig
count was 1,078, with 283 rigs, or 26.3%, within our primary market. The
quarterly fluctuations in the Canadian rig count generally reflect the seasonal
nature of drilling activity related to drilling site access. As of the week
ended November 3, 2000, the Canadian rig count was 362.

         Since the first quarter of 1999, we have seen steady improvement in
crude oil and natural gas prices, which continued into the third quarter of
2000. With the improvement in oil and gas prices in the second half of 1999, the
average rig activity increased for the first time in six quarters during the
third quarter of 1999. The increase in rig activity has continued through the
third quarter of 2000, but has trailed the recovery in oil and gas prices.

         During 2000, gas storage levels reached their lowest point in over
three years, and current industry forecasts reflect a stable to growing demand
for natural gas. In addition, current productive gas reserves are being depleted
at a rate faster than current

drilling activity will increase over current levels. Because many shallow fields
in the Gulf Coast market have been exploited, producers are expected to increase
the depth of drilling to reach larger gas reserves. As such, we expect gas
drilling activity to be increasingly associated with deeper, more costly wells.

         In September 1999, we decided to discontinue our solids control
operations and simultaneously entered into an alliance agreement with a division
of Tuboscope, which is now providing some of these services to our customers.
Prior year results for these solids control operations were previously reported
as discontinued operations. Operating results for the prior year have been
restated to give effect to the reclassification of these results from a
presentation as discontinued operations to a presentation as part of continuing
operations of our fluids sales and engineering segment. Operating results for
the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1999 have also been restated to
reflect the cumulative effect of an accounting change effective January 1, 1999.
Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the
three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 is shown

QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999

Revenues

         E&P Waste Disposal: The $5.6 million, or 56%, increase in waste
disposal revenue is attributable to the increases in drilling activity and the
resulting increase in waste volumes received. Drilling rig activity in our
primary gulf coast market increased 48% during the third quarter of 2000
compared to the same period in 1999. During the third quarter of 2000, we
received 1,091,000 barrels of E&P waste compared to 784,000 barrels in the
comparable quarter of 1999, a 39% increase. Average revenue per barrel increased
from $10.60 per barrel in 1999 to $11.51 per barrel in 2000. Revenues for the
quarter ended September 30, 2000 included $574,000 from nonhazardous industrial
disposal operations, which began in August 1999. Revenues from these operations
were $176,000 in the comparable period of 1999. NORM revenues were $1.5 million
in 2000, as compared to $600,000 in 1999.

         Recently, we have seen an increase in activity in the environmentally
sensitive South Louisiana Transition Zone, which should translate into future
revenue growth if the trend continues. This development is important, since a
Transition Zone drilling rig generates five to six times the waste volume of
other, less tightly regulated markets. In addition, we are continuing to work
with our customers to implement a 4% price increase, which we expect to be fully
implemented by the end of the fourth quarter. This price increase is in response
to increases in certain operating costs.

         New offshore regulations regarding the limitation of discharges of
synthetic fluids and drill cuttings containing synthetic fluids have recently
been announced and are expected to be effective in early 2001. These
regulations, as proposed, would eliminate the discharge of synthetic fluids and
would reduce the allowable percentage of drill cuttings containing synthetic
fluids to 6.9% of total discharges by volume. We expect to experience some
increase in waste volumes as a result of these new regulations once they become
effective.

         Fluids Sales and Engineering: Fluids sales and engineering revenues
increased $7.9 million, or 30%. During the third quarter of 2000, we serviced an
average of 152 rigs, compared to 94 rigs in the third quarter of 1999. The
average annualized revenue per rig was approximately $890,000 in the third
quarter of 2000, compared to $881,000 for the third quarter of 1999. We are
continuing to work with our customers to implement an average price increase of
5%-6%, which we expect to be fully implemented by the end of the fourth quarter.

                                       14

<PAGE>   15

         Revenues of this segment include revenues from solids control
operations of approximately $2.0 million in the third quarter of 1999. There
were no solids control revenues in the third quarter of 2000. These operations
were discontinued in September 1999. Certain solids control contracts that
remained in progress as of December 31, 1999 were completed by June 2000. The
average annualized revenue per rig, excluding solids control revenues, was
$791,000 for the third quarter of 1999.

         Many of our drilling fluids customers are independent operators that
are active in the inland waters and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico markets.
Recently these areas have seen an increase in activity. Drilling in these
markets usually involves more complicated drilling programs resulting in greater
amounts of drilling fluids sales and engineering services as compared to other
land drilling markets.

         Mat and Integrated Services: The $4.6 million, or 31%, increase in mat
and integrated services revenues is due to both an increase in pricing and an
increase in volume of mat locations associated with increases in drilling
activity and expansion of Canadian operations. The average price per square foot
for mat locations installed was $0.99 in the third quarter of 2000, compared to
$0.59 in the third quarter of 1999 and $.71 in the second quarter of 2000. The
average pricing in the prior year was negatively impacted by weak demand and the
lack of Transition Zone work, which tends to earn a premium in pricing for mat
locations due to the complexity and size of the projects. Beginning late in the
third quarter of 2000, we have seen a significant increase in mat locations for
drilling in the Transition Zone market, and we have indications from our
customers that this market will continue to be active for the remainder of the
year and into 2001. Should the activity in this market continue to increase, we
believe it would have a positive impact on both revenues and operating margins
for this segment.

         Canadian mat revenues were $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2000,
compared to $700,000 for the third quarter of 1999. Canadian mat revenues for
2000 include rental charges associated with a pending sale of 1,000 mats to a
Canadian E&P company, subject to a 60-day evaluation period. This customer has
recently accepted these mats, for which additional sales revenues will be
recorded in the fourth quarter. This customer has also agreed to purchase an
additional 500 mats in the fourth quarter and is evaluating the purchase of more
mats for projects planned during the spring of 2001 when site access problems
traditionally begin to increase. We are continuing to pursue the military,
governmental and commercial markets for sales of our composite mat system. We
continue to believe that our efforts in this new market should begin to show
positive results in the near future.

Operating Income

         E&P Waste Disposal: The $2.9 million increase in waste disposal
operating income represents a 125% increase from the prior year period and an
incremental margin (the increase in operating income divided by the increase in
revenue) of 53%. Increases in certain operating costs, including barge rental,
maintenance (in particular at our west Texas operations), personnel, fuel and
utility costs, negatively impacted the incremental margin for this segment.
Offsetting these increases in operating costs for the quarter was an increase in
higher-margin NORM revenues from $600,000 in 1999 to $1.5 million in 2000.

                                       15

<PAGE>   16

         As noted above, we are continuing to implement a 4% price increase.
This price increase, along with moderating costs, are expected to improve the
incremental margins for this segment over the remainder of the year.

         Fluids Sales and Engineering: Fluids sales and engineering operating
income increased $4.1 million on a $7.9 million increase in revenues. Operating
income for this segment includes the results of our solids control operations,
which were discontinued in September 1999. Included in the operating loss for
the fluids sales and engineering segment for the quarter ended September 30,
1999 is an operating loss of $2.2 million associated with solids control
operations. Excluding the effects of the solids control operations in the prior
year, operating income in this segment increased $1.9 million, representing an
incremental margin of 19%.

         The operating margin of the drilling fluids segment is affected by the
mix of products sold. There is a significant difference in the gross margins
recognized on commodity products, primarily barite, and those recognized for
specialty products. We expect to recognize the benefits of newly introduced
products such as DeepDrill(TM) and other specialty products as these products
gain wider customer acceptance. We expect to obtain better margins on commodity
products as market activity increases, which should improve pricing and lower
product costs. In addition, as noted above, we are continuing to implement a
5%-6% price increase over the remainder of 2000. The positive effects of these
price increases and increases in the mix of higher margin products are expected
to be partially offset by increases in certain operating costs, including fuel,
personnel and infrastructure costs of expanded offshore base operations.

         Mat and Integrated Services: Mat and integrated services operating
income increased $4.7 million on a $4.6 million increase in revenues. The high
incremental margin is attributable to reductions in operating costs and improved
pricing due to favorable changes in mix; however, we do not anticipate that
incremental margins will be as high in the future. During 1998 and 1999, we
disposed of a significant portion of our domestic wooden mat fleet. In 1999, we
also recorded an impairment charge for our remaining domestic wooden mat fleet,
in response to both changing market conditions and our introduction of the new
composite mat. This reduction in basis significantly lowered depreciation
expense for the mat fleet. In addition, the significantly lower maintenance,
transportation, and other associated costs, and substantially longer useful life
of the composite mat system as compared to the wooden mat system are expected to
enhance future operating margins for this segment. These benefits of the
composite mat system are also expected to better position the segment to compete
against competitive pricing pressures.

Interest Income/Expense

         Net interest expense was $4.4 million for the third quarter of 2000, an
increase of $468,000, or 11.9%, as compared to $3.9 million for the third
quarter of 1999. The increase in net interest cost is due to an increase in the
average effective interest rate from 8.94% in 1999 to 9.48% in 2000. This
increase in the effective interest rate was partially offset by a reduction in
average borrowings outstanding of $2.6 million. In addition, interest
capitalization decreased from $451,000 in the third quarter of 1999 to $220,000
in the third quarter of 2000. As noted below, in June 2000, we issued $30
million of preferred stock and warrants, the proceeds of which were used for the
repayment of debt. During the third

                                       16

<PAGE>   17

quarter of 2000, the interest rate on the credit facility was reduced from Prime
plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 4% to prime plus .75% or LIBOR plus 3.25% as financial
ratios improved the variable grid pricing on our credit facility.

Provision for Income Taxes

         For the quarter ended September 30, 2000, we recorded an income tax
provision of $2.7 million, reflecting an income tax rate of 40.5%. For the
quarter ended September 30, 1999, we recorded an income tax provision of $805
million, on a pretax loss of $7.1 million. The effective tax rate for 2000 is
higher than statutory rates primarily due to effects of non-deductible goodwill
and the comparatively low projected annual income from operations for 2000.

Preferred Stock Dividends and Accretion of Discount

         As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources below, in June 2000, we
sold 120,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In April 1999, we sold 150,000
shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is not
redeemable. The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at our option anytime
after April 16, 2004. For the quarter ended September 30, 2000, dividends
totaling $525,000 were paid or accrued on preferred stock. This compares to
$188,000 of dividends for the quarter ended September 30, 1999. The accretion of
the discount on the Series A Preferred Stock was $112,000 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999.

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 1999

Revenues

         E&P Waste Disposal: The $11.0 million, or 36%, increase in waste
disposal revenue is attributable to the increases in drilling activity and the
resulting increase in waste volumes received. In these same periods, drilling
rig activity in the Gulf Coast market, our primary market, increased 36%. During
the first nine months of 2000, we received 3,094,000 barrels of E&P waste,
compared to 2,361,000 barrels in the comparable period of 1999, a 31% increase.
Average revenue per barrel increased slightly during the comparable periods. The
nine months ended September 30, 2000 included $1.2 million of revenue from
nonhazardous industrial disposal operations, which began in August 1999,
compared to approximately $200,000 in 1999.

         Fluids Sales and Engineering: Fluids sales and engineering revenues
increased $25.3 million, or 37%. During the first nine months of 2000, we
serviced an average of 138 rigs, compared to 82 rigs in the first nine months of
1999. The annualized average revenue per rig was approximately $892,000 in the
first nine months of 2000 compared to $1,024,000 for the first nine months of
1999. The decline in the annualized revenue per rig is due to the mix of rig
locations, with a lower percentage of rigs serviced in 2000 in the Gulf Coast
market, which generates a larger volume of drilling fluids revenue per rig
serviced. In addition, the annualized revenue per rig was impacted by the
decision to discontinue operations of the solids control operations. Revenues
from solids control operations were $883,000 for the first nine months of 2000
and $5.3 million for the first nine months of 1999. The average revenue per rig
excluding solids control revenues was $884,000 for the first nine months of 2000
and $938,000 for the first nine months of 1999.

                                       17

<PAGE>   18

         Mat and Integrated Services: The $6.0 million, or 13%, increase in mat
and integrated services revenue is significantly lower than the increase in rig
activity, primarily due to weakness in the wetlands and Transition Zone market
in the first half of 2000. This weakness was partially offset by improvement in
pricing and expansion of Canadian operations. The average price per square foot
was $0.83 in the first nine months of 2000, compared to $0.64 in the first nine
months of 1999. Canadian mat revenues were $5.2 million for the first nine
months of 2000, compared to $1.3 million for the first nine months of 1999.

Operating Income

         E&P Waste Disposal: The $3.9 million increase in waste disposal
operating income represents a 42% increase from the prior year period and an
incremental margin of 36%. As noted above, increases in certain operating costs,
including barge rental, maintenance, personnel, fuel and utility costs,
negatively impacted the incremental margin for this segment. In addition, as
noted previously, the mix of waste received during the first six months of 2000
included a greater percentage of products that required special handling and
processing costs that were unusual in nature, resulting in a lower than expected
incremental margin.

         Fluids Sales and Engineering: Fluids sales and engineering operating
income increased $15.6 million on an increase in revenue of $25.3 million. The
operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 included site
closure and related costs of approximately $2.6 million. In addition, operating
income for this segment includes the results of our solids control operations,
which were discontinued in September 1999. Included in the operating loss for
the fluids sales and engineering segment for the nine months ended September 30,
1999 is an operating loss of $3.8 million associated with solids control
operations. Excluding the effects of solids control operations and site closure
costs in the prior year, operating income in this segment increased $9.2
million, representing an incremental margin of 31%.

         Mat and Integrated Services: The $8.5 million increase in mat and
integrated services operating income is attributable to several factors. These
include the $6.0 million increase in revenues, improved per unit pricing and
reductions in operating costs, particularly depreciation, associated with
resizing our domestic wooden mat fleet and introducing our new composite mat
system, as noted above.

Interest Income/Expense

         Net interest expense was $13.3 million for 2000, an increase of $1.8
million, or 16.4%, as compared to $11.4 million for 1999. The increase in net
interest cost is due to an increase of $6.9 million in average outstanding
borrowings and an increase in the average effective interest rate from 8.88% in
1999 to 9.50% in 2000. In addition, interest capitalization decreased from $1.3
million in the first nine months of 1999 to $740,000 in the first nine months of
2000. The increase in average outstanding borrowings under our bank credit
facility was primarily used to fund capital expenditures. As noted below, in
June 2000, the Company issued $30 million of preferred stock, the proceeds of
which where used to repay debt.

                                       18

<PAGE>   19

Provision for Income Taxes

         For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, we recorded an income tax
provision of $4.4 million, reflecting an income tax rate of 40.4%. For the nine
months ended September 30, 1999, we recorded an income tax benefit of $4.8
million, reflecting an income tax benefit rate of 27.7%. The effective tax rate
for 2000 is higher than statutory rates primarily due to effects of
non-deductible goodwill and the comparatively low projected annual income from
operations for 2000.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

         Results for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 includes the
cumulative effect, net of income taxes, of a change in accounting for
depreciation on certain assets used in our barite grinding activity and in our
waste disposal business. As a result of this change in accounting for
depreciation, the reported income from operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 1999 was increased by $1,471,000, with related per share amounts
of $.02 basic and diluted. This reflects the cumulative effect, net of income
taxes, of the change on years prior to 1999.

Preferred Stock Dividends and Accretion of Discount

         For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, dividends totaling $1.0
million were paid or accrued on preferred stock. This compares to $344,000 of
dividends for the first nine months of 1999. The accretion of the discount on
the Series A Preferred Stock was $336,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2000. This compares to $206,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
1999.

         As required by EITF 98-5 "Accounting for Convertible Securities with
Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios",
during the nine months ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a one-time
adjustment of $3.5 million ($.05 per share) to our equity accounts to reflect
the value assigned to the conversion feature of the Series B Preferred Stock at
the date of issuance. This adjustment did not have any effect on our operating
results or total equity, and we issued no additional shares or cash.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The Company's working capital position increased by $21.7 million
during the first nine months of 2000. Key working capital data is provided below

         For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, our working capital needs
were met primarily from the preferred stock offering discussed below. The net
cash provided by financing activities of $20.5 million and net cash provided by
operating activities of $504,000 helped to provide for total cash of $23.2
million used in investing activities.

         As of September 30, 2000, we also maintained a $100.0 million bank
credit facility, including up to $20.0 million in standby letters of credit, in
the form of a revolving line of credit commitment, which expires December 31,
2001. We are currently in discussions with the banks to enter into a new $125
million credit facility. This new facility is anticipated to have terms similar
to the existing credit facility. These discussions are expected to be completed
by December 31, 2000.

         At September 30, 2000, $15.8 million in letters of credit were issued
and outstanding under the credit facility and $73.5 million was outstanding
under the revolving facility, leaving $10.7 million of availability under this
facility at September 30, 2000. The facility bears interest at either a
specified prime rate (9.5% at September 30, 2000) or the LIBOR rate (6.68% at
September 30, 2000) plus a spread determined quarterly based on the ratio of our
funded debt to cash flow. The current interest rate under the credit facility is
prime plus .75% (10.25% at November 3, 2000) or LIBOR plus 3.25% (9.85% at
November 3, 2000). We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the
credit facility as of September 30, 2000.

         Our Senior Subordinated Notes do not contain any financial covenants.
However, if we do not meet the financial covenants of the Credit Facility and
are unable to obtain an amendment from the banks, we would be in default under
the Credit Facility, which would cause the Notes to be in default. The Notes and
the Credit Facility also contain covenants that significantly limit the payment
of dividends on our Common Stock.

         On June 1, 2000, we completed the sale to Fletcher International
Limited of 120,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par
value per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), and a warrant (the "Warrant")
to purchase up to 1,900,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of
$10.075 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Warrant has a term
of seven years, expiring June 1, 2007. There are no redemption features to the
Series B Preferred Stock. The aggregate purchase price for these instruments was
$30.0 million, of which approximately $26.5 million was allocated to the Series
B Preferred Stock and approximately $3.5 million to the Warrant. The net
proceeds from the sale were used to repay indebtedness.

         For the next twelve months, we anticipate total capital expenditures of
approximately $26 million, primarily associated with the purchase of composite
mats.

                                       20

<PAGE>   21

         Approximately $7 million of operating lease funding was obtained in
2000 for the leasing of new composite mats. We have also obtained a commitment
for up to $5 million of additional operating lease financing for new composite
mats, which we expect to utilize in the fourth quarter of 2000. We are in the
process of selling our office building in Lafayette, Louisiana that should yield
approximately $3.2 million. We plan to subsequently lease this facility from the
new owner under an operating lease.

         Potential sources of additional funds, if required, would include
additional operating leases for equipment, selling certain assets and selling
equity securities or subordinated debt securities. Other than as discussed
above, we presently have no commitments beyond our working capital and bank
lines of credit by which we could obtain additional funds for current
operations. However, we regularly evaluate potential borrowing arrangements
which we may utilize to fund future expansion. We believe that our current
sources of capital, coupled with internally generated funds, will be sufficient
to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service
requirements for the foreseeable future provided that market conditions
stabilize or continue to improve from current levels. Any long-term downturn in
market conditions could have an adverse affect on our financial position,
results of operations and future available capital. Such a downturn would likely
result in reductions in planned capital expenditures and reassessment of our
operations and business strategy in light of these market conditions.

         Except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we are not aware of
any material expenditures, significant balloon payments or other payments on
long term obligations or any other demands or commitments, including off-balance
sheet items to be incurred within the next 12 months. Inflation has not
materially impacted our revenues or income.

YEAR 2000 UPDATE

         In prior years, we have disclosed the nature and progress of our plans
to address the year 2000 issue. By the end of 1999, we completed our remediation
and testing of our critical information technology and non-information
technology systems. As a result of those efforts, we experienced no significant
disruptions in those systems and believe those systems successfully responded to
the year 2000 date change. We expended less than $100,000 during 1998 and 1999
in connection with remediating our systems. We are not aware of any material
problems resulting from year 2000 issues, either with our product or service
offerings, our internal systems or the products and services of third parties.
We will continue to monitor our critical computer applications and those of our
suppliers and vendors throughout the year 2000 to ensure that any latent year
2000 matters that may arise are addressed promptly.

          the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Permian Basin
          of West Texas and New Mexico and the Anadarko Basin in Western
          Oklahoma, where we have only recently entered the market; and

     o    adverse weather conditions, which could disrupt drilling operations.
